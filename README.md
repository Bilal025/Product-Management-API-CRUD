# Product Management System

Welcome to the Product Management System API project! This API provides a set of endpoints for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on product data. It is built using the Spring framework and is intended as a practice project to enhance my skills in building web APIs using Java. This project serves as a stepping stone toward my ultimate goal of creating a canteen management system in the future.

**Features**
* Create new products
* Retrieve a list of all products
* Update product information
* Delete a product

**Technologies Used**
* Java
* Spring Framework (Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA)
* MySQL
* Maven

**Installation**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Create a MySQL database for the project and configure the database connection in the '_application.properties_' file.
3. Build the project using Maven.
4. Build the project using Maven.

The API should now be running at '_http://localhost:8080._'

You can interact with the API using tools like Postman or by integrating it into your frontend application. 

**Endpoints**

* Add a new Product: **POST /product/addNewProduct**
* Get All Product Details: **GET /product/addNewProduct**
* Update Product: **POST /product/updateProduct**
* Delete Product: **DELETE /product/deleteProduct/{id}**
